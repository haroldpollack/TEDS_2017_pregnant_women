# TEDS_2017_pregnant_women
This is a pretty program that finds women of childbearing age and pregnant women receiving Medication Opioid Use Disorder (MOUD) treatment in the TEDS-A (Treatment Episode Data Set: Admissions 2017). 
It's a pretty clunky program, but may be useful for MCH folk. I included program output, and I also included the .CSV file read by the program. Please feel free to use.
